# Phantasia Tours

This is a website for a fictional tour company where all the destinations are from works of fiction. From the icy climes of Hoth to the sweltering deserts of Arrakis to the lush hills of the Shire, Phantasia Tours has a destination for everyone.

The only limit is your imagination.

### Future Plans

Once the bones of the site are up, I plan to link each Region and Tour to a place to purchase the fictional work it originates in. If possible, this will be an independent bookseller, but some just aren't books.

I also plan to write up decent descriptions of each place, and have at least a few blog posts. I have a few people writing little opinion pieces about destinations, as though they are giving reviews or were hired by Phantasia Tours to write articles.
